   ```

3. **Set up database** (choose one option):

   **ðŸš€ Option A: Railway (Recommended - Production ready)**
   ```bash
   # 1. Go to https://railway.app and create a project
   # 2. Add PostgreSQL service
   # 3. Copy your connection string
   # 4. Create .env file:
   echo 'DATABASE_URL="your-railway-connection-string"' > .env
   echo 'NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"' >> .env
   echo 'NEXTAUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"' >> .env
   ```

   **ðŸ†“ Option B: Neon (Free tier)**
   ```bash
   # 1. Go to https://neon.tech and create a project
   # 2. Copy your connection string
   # 3. Create .env file with your connection string
   ```

   **ðŸ”§ Option C: Local PostgreSQL**
   ```bash
   # If you have PostgreSQL installed locally
   createdb expensetracker
   echo 'DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/expensetracker"' > .env
   ```

4. Set up database tables:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Environment Variables

Create `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Required: PostgreSQL connection string
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database_name"

# Required for authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32"

# For production deployment
# NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-app-url.com"
```

### Database Setup

After setting up your database connection:
